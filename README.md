#c-gratitude-cli

This is a simple CLI tool created in C to keep track of things you're 
grateful for. It's REALLY simple at the moment, but I'm hoping to add more 
features to it.

For now, all it does is ask you the things you're grateful for, and you 
can enter in however many you want, and it will create a new file with 
your entries. 

# Installation
```bash
$ gcc main.c
```

# Usage
```bash
$ ./a.out
```

It'll get much better, I promise!
